# BrailleBook-Decoder-V2
This represents the work and changes I have put in to make this device come to life

ABOUT THE PROJECT 

The whole project or 'version' is coded and wired by Dimitar Georgiev(me).

But let's not forget Michael Metodiev who made the body and pushing mechanism.

Braille Book is a device designed to make reading accessible and enjoyable for individuals with visual impairments. It's a compact and lightweight tool powered by Arduino UNO microcontroller driving 6 servo motors representing the braille letter.
Designed for use by sighted individuals, Braille Decoder enables users to assist their visually impaired peers in accessing digital content with ease and empathy.
Offering both Text and Number Modes, Braille Decoder seamlessly connects to Braille Book via Bluetooth, allowing sighted users to send text messages, emails, documents, and numerical data to the Braille Book device for instant translation into Braille format.
